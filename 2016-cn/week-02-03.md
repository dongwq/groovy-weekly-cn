This is a two week edition, as I was busy visiting India and especially GR8Conf India last week. What a couple of weeks, the Groovy Ecosystem is indeed alive as the amount of news will reveal.

这是两周的版本，上个星期我去印度游玩，当然主要还是去参加GR8Conf印度大会。多么繁忙的两周，这两周有大量的新闻发生，Groovy生态还是挺活跃的。  

The Grails team at OCI have released Grails 3.0.12, with some significant startup time improvements, due to a change in classes scanned at the classpath. Read the [release notes](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.0.12) for hints on upgrading.  

OCI公司的Grails团队发布了Grails 3.0.12版本，该版本改变了在类路径扫描类的方式，明显加快了启动速度。 可以阅读一下[发布笔记](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.0.12)查看所有的更新。   

 The second release candidate of Grails 3.1.0.RC2 is also ready, where the [Release Notes](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.1.0.RC2) reveals better profile support, a new angularJS profile, GORM 5 suite and much more.  
 
 Grails的第二个候选版本 3.1.0.RC2也要发布了， [发布笔记中](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.1.0.RC2)提到该版本更好支持profile，加入了新的angularJS profile，GORM5套件等。  

 Along with Grails 3.1, the deprecated filters support will be removed, but may find its way into a plugin. Jeff Scott Brown was searching for someone to make a contribution for this. The task is [Pull Filters Support Out Of Core And Into Separate Plugin](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/9363), including the removed code in [this project](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-filters), removed from core [here](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/pull/9524).

The heroes of the week must be Matt Sheehan, Eric Helgeson and Bobby Warner for building a plugin portal for Grails 3 plugins: [grails-plugins.org](http://grails-plugins.org/). It comes with better searching and sorting than the bintray page.

Sapan Parikh has made a [sample application](https://github.com/sapanparikh18/Grails-3.1-AngularJS/tree/master) using the new AngulaeJS profile for Grails 3.1, demoing routing with a controller.

The GPars project for concurrency and parallelism has an updated website, which is really cool looking (and a huge upgrade from the old): [http://gpars.website](http://gpars.website)

The first release candidate for [Gradle 2.11-rc-1](https://docs.gradle.org/release-candidate/release-notes) is ready. Improvements continue for the new software model and continuous build. Also Gradle related; you should follow [@DailyGradle](https://twitter.com/DailyGradle) on twitter for tips on using Gradle, by Schalk Cronjé.

On SDKMan, all the above releases are of course available, and also Ant is now a candidate.  
 Even better, the switch extension command, that automatically detects a projects Grails or Griffon version is now also working for Grails 3, thanks to a pull request by Ronny Løvtangen (hero of the week #2)

In the Groovy world, Guillaume has answered a couple of good questions on Quora:

*   [What are the pros and cons of Groovy?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-Groovy/answer/Guillaume-Laforge?share=dc0deaca)
*   [Since Google is moving Android to OpenJDK, will it also move from Java to Groovy to avoid litigation from Oracle](https://www.quora.com/Since-Google-is-moving-Android-to-OpenJDK-will-it-also-move-from-Java-to-Groovy-to-avoid-litigation-from-Oracle/answer/Guillaume-Laforge?share=cd32d64f)

The first Ratpack book is now complete! Sorry Dan Woods you were not fast enough, Mr Haki's [Ratpacked Notebook](http://mrhaki.blogspot.dk/2016/01/ratpacked-notebook-is-published.html) is available on [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/ratpacked-notebook)  
 Ken and Baruch gave Dan a hard time in the latest [Groovy Podcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89AObYebcpU), ignoring the time it takes them between podcasts ;) It is however as always fun to listen to. [Dan Woods](https://twitter.com/danveloper/status/690653708036640773) says "Learning Ratpack" is on schedule for a March publish

In other book related news, Kostis Kapelonis, the author of "Java Testing with Spock" points out errata should be posted [here](https://forums.manning.com/posts/list/37525.page;jsessionid=2D25BAC788D387988CC13456E04FD368).

GR8Conf EU and Gradle will bring a Gradle miniSummit to Copenhagen on June 1st-3rd. The call for paper is still [open](http://cfp.gr8conf.org/login/auth), for both GR8Conf EU, GR8Conf US and a new mini conference in Warsaw, the GR8Day Warsaw on March 19th.

For Greach, there is one week left for buying [early bird tickets](http://greachconf.com/#tickets).

#### GR8Conf India

This year I had the pleasure of visiting GR8Conf India for the first time. It is also the first time with that name, as the conference was called Grailsconf before.

It is an excellent venue, organised perfectly by a the crew from To the New Digital. Roni and Manoj reminded everyone in their opening speach that conferences are a great oportunity to network and meet new people.  
 This was the first time Burt Beckwith gave a keynote at a conference! With some historic insights into the Grails project, and his take on the 'State of the Union' of Grails.

The event was in two tracks, both live streamed on the #fame app, that Himanshu Seth also gave a great presentation on, and had thousinds of viewers. The event was a mix of Indian and foreign speakers, including Burt, Paul King, Søren Glasius, Naresha K and myself. I've collected some of the slides and material below, and the talks should be available on Youtube at a later point in time.

In all ways, GR8Conf India exceeded my expectations! And I had not figured that it was at the speakers dinner I would learn a new ritual: The Captains Game, but it was fun. I'm not the only one impressed, see the following reviews:
