# Grails Diary - Week 12 in 2016 <small>28-03-2016</small>

> original at (link)[http://grydeske.net/news/show/132]

This easter edition of the Grails Diary is quite short. I'm not the only one that has taken some time off. In less than two weeks, Greach will be in the books, and I have spend some of the easter break preparing my presentation. The Javascript/Node world has taken the most headlines, and this edition is a bit thin on news.

In the Conferences and meetups section, you can see that Mexico is now on the Grails map; as the first Grails first meetup in now announced. Also Grails relevant news: Burt Beckwith has released a bugfix version of the [spring-security-core](https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/) Grails 3 plugin.

With the noise from the npm world this week, it might be worth checking out Craig Burke's [client-dependencies-gradle](https://github.com/craigburke/client-dependencies-gradle) plugin, which is newly released in version 0.5.0\. It allows you to declare client side dependencies bower, npm or git querying the registries directly so it doesn’t require or install node, npm or bower. The next version should be 1.0.

Schalk Cronjé has also updated the [GradleTest plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.ysb33r.gradletest), now in version 0.5.5\. With it, it is easier to test compatibility with various versions on Gradle.

Liviu Tudor has shared his slides on "Managing dependencies with gradle" in the in Netflix Ads Engineering department.

In a quiet week, it is always worth to take on an old discussion: "Is it pssible to write build.gradle in pure Java..?", is one of them. You can find it [the Gradle Forum,](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/possible-to-write-build-gradle-in-pure-java/9317/38?u=schalk_cronje) with replies from Schalk Cronjé, Hans Docktor, Luke Daley etc.

Eric Helgeson has made a demo on how to [use Redis to externalize your sessions](https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails3-redis-session/commits/master) in Grails 3.1.4

GR8Conf Eu tickets have been on sale for a while, but now [GR8Conf US registration is open,](https://ti.to/gr8conf/gr8conf-2016) and Door Buster tickets are still available.

At Greach, the surprise session is now officially a [Groovy puzzlers show with Noam Tenne!](https://t.co/7NNv3OHYML) It will be the first time at Greach, but always worth it!
