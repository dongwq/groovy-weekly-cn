# Grails Diary - Week 16 and 17 in 2016 <small>03-05-2016</small>

> original at (link)[http://grydeske.net/news/show/135]

Lots of releases and blog posts highlights this two week edition!

The Ratpack team is using the big motor in the release process, having released versions 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, and 1.3.3. The release notes for [1.3.0](https://ratpack.io/versions/1.3.0) are the interesting ones, as the other bugfix releases are upgrades to Netty and downgrade of Groovy to 2.4.4 due to a bug in Grab.

Juan Vazquez has shared [code and slides](https://github.com/javazquez/Ratpack-Tutorial) from a Omaha Java Users meetup with a Ratpack tutorial, also displaying an example on using Dropwizard metrics.

GORM has been updated to version 5.0.5, and with that provides support for Hibernate 5.1, and is included in the latest release of Grails, version [3.1.6](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.1.6). The Grails team has also released version [3.0.17](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.0.17). 3.1.6 also has a change for plugins, where the Application class should implement GrailsPluginApplication interface. 3.0.17 is fixing a few minor bugs.

The Grails team has created a shared blog, and the first handfull of blog posts have been posted at [grailsblog.ociweb.com](http://grailsblog.ociweb.com/).

If you are using Twitter, there is now a new account with daily Groovy tips you should follow:[@DailyGroovyLang](https://twitter.com/DailyGroovyLang)

I doubt many who reads this is doubt of the awesomeness of Groovy, but if you need to convince anyone, these slides on [Apache Groovy: the language and the ecosystem](http://www.slideshare.net/KostasSaidis/apache-groovy-the-language-and-the-ecosystem) by Kostas Saidis and Agapios Avramidis provides a top list of reasons why to use Groovy.

Gradle 2.13 has been released, and comes with nice performance improvements, easier plugin development, and customizations for FindBugs and Checkstyle. See more in the [releasenotes](https://docs.gradle.org/2.13/release-notes), or in the [forum announcement.](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/gradle-2-13-released/17017)

Schalk Cronjé has been busy presenting at conferences, and has shared slides on [Using the Groovy universe for rapid JVM dev](http://www.slideshare.net/ysb33r/using-the-groovy-ecosystem-for-rapid-jvm-development), and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ysb33r/cool-jvm-tools-to-help-you-test) and [source code](https://github.com/ysb33r/FastTrackJvm/tree/AtaGtr2016) for "Cool Tools on the JVM to Help You Test", the later including a demo on using Ratpack's TestHttpClient standalone.

Benoit Hediard has beta released several plugins fro Grails 3, which can assist you in working with AWS. He describes more in the blog post: [AWS SDK Plugins for Grails 3](https://medium.com/@benorama/aws-sdk-plugins-for-grails-3-cc7f910fdc0d#.d3twg8pbf)

The GPars documentation has moved to the [gpars.org website](http://gpars.org).

I've begun preparing my presentation for GR8Conf EU, I hope to see you there, tickets are still available at [gr8conf.eu](http://gr8conf.eu/)
