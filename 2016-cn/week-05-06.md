# Grails Diary - Week 5 and 6 in 2016 <small>15-02-2016</small>

> original at (link)[http://grydeske.net/news/show/127]

This time again a two week edition of the Grails Diary. I was too busy last sunday, and I think 2016 will see a lot more of bi-weekly diaries. The best thing about a two week edition: Twice the amount of great material from the Groovy Ecosystem!

The Grails team released version [3.1.1](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.1.1), with support for reloading of subprojects/plugins. Graeme wrote a [blog post](http://grails.io/post/138665751278/grails-3-gradle-multi-project-builds) with more information, and he mentions this is a result of Grails being with OCI and the team of developpers that report issues back from daily life.

Again in February, [Groovy is in top 20 of the Tiobe index](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html). It has become a pleasent habit!

Gradle has been released in version 2.11, [the release notes](https://docs.gradle.org/2.11/release-notes) reveal that this brings improvements for [the new software model](https://docs.gradle.org/2.11/userguide/software_model.html), working towards a Gradle 3.0 release. Also this release improves the dependability of continoues build, which I personnally finds extremely useful.

The Ratpack team has both release candidate 1 and 2, for the upcomming 1.2.0 release out. The still unreleased 1.2.0 version will bring lots of improvements, as you can read [in the draft of the release notes.](https://ratpack.io/versions/1.2.0) Most notable is maybe the new utility for simple publish/subscribe with promises, see the [the API description for Promised](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.2.0/api/ratpack/exec/util/Promised.html).

Adam L. Davis is 99% done with his Leanpub book: "Learning Groovy", which also covers Gradle, Grails, Spock, Ratpack and more. You can buy it at [leanpub.com/learninggroovy](https://leanpub.com/learninggroovy).

Guilaume Laforge mentions there is a [Slack channel underway for Groovy](https://twitter.com/glaforge/status/694434114158600192), But until then, don't forget that both [Grails](https://grails.slack.com/) and [Ratpack](https://ratpack.slack.com) already have channels.

Andrew Reitz have released version 0.3.8 of the gradle-groovy-android-plugin, which adds Groovy language support for Android. It is available from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/groovy/gradle-plugins/gradle-groovy-android-plugin/0.3.8/view!).

Groovy Users of Minnesota had Jenn Strater giving a presentation on "Test-Driven Approaches to Documenting RESTful APIs", and while there is no video, Jenn has shared her [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jlstrater/test-driven-approaches-to-documenting-restful-apis).

Geb is out in version 0.13.0, with a few breaking changes, and a bunch of new features and improvements. It is now build with Groovy 2.4.5 and Spock 1.0-groovy-2.4, and there is a number of Navigator methods that would operate on first element of a multi element Navigator now throw an exception when called on a multi element navigator. The short description of the updates is [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/geb-user/d1mEHWCMePY) and the long version is in [the Book of Geb](http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/#0-13-0). For Grails the plugin is also upgraded to use the new version.

GR8Conf has spawned a new little sister: GR8Days, and the first event is [GR8Day Warsaw 2016](http://warsaw.gr8days.pl/) in Poland. You can submit talks now, [as the CFP is open!](http://cfp.gr8conf.org/login/auth)

The Speakers for Greach 2016 can now be found on this twitter list: [twitter.com/greachconf/lists/speakers2016](https://twitter.com/greachconf/lists/speakers2016). Sorry for the self promotion, but I'm really looking forward to visiting Madrid again, as Greach has been fantastic the last two times I have attended.
