# Grails Diary - Week 10 and 11 in 2016 <small>21-03-2016</small>

> original at (link)[http://grydeske.net/news/show/132]

In this two week edition of the Grails Diary, the first videos from GR8Conf India have been published, there are lots of articles, and links to materials from the GR8Day in Warsaw.

The Grails team at OCI have released Grails 3.1.4 with some bug fixes and improvements, especially is it now possible to create new apps, without running into profile issues. The [changelog](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.1.4) also reveals a new feature: [ad-hoc constraints for validation](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/9599).

The plugin portal at the official Grails website is now integrated by the excellent work of Matt Sheehan, Eric Helgeson and Bobby Warner. You can see the result at [grails.org/plugins.html](https://grails.org/plugins.html)

If you are using Emacs as your editor, there is now an [emacs minor mode for grails](https://github.com/lifeisfoo/emacs-grails), which allows you to move (jump) between grails files easily, with more features are coming. Thank you Alessandro Miliucci for pointing to this news

Gradle 2.12 is now available in the final release. The [release notes](https://docs.gradle.org/2.12/release-notes) has all the details, but the long avaited feature is the support for declaring compile time only dependencies.  
 Rene Groeschke pointed out that Gradle had [29 contributers in february](https://www.openhub.net/p/gradle/contributors/summary)

Recently the very first GR8Day Warsaw event was held. From the feedback I've seen, it appears to have been a success. Below is some of the materials (slides/code) used.

There is a new Alpha release of [Betamax](http://betamax.software/) 2.0 available, which works with Groovy 2.4.x.

Jenn Strater has worked on making Spring REST docs work with Ratpack, and it has found its way into [one of the sample apps](https://github.com/ratpack/example-books/blob/master/src/test/groovy/ratpack/examples/book/docs/BookDocumentationSpec.groovy), as well as an example using [Grails](https://github.com/jlstrater/grails-spring-restdocs-example). Slides from her talk [A Test Driven Approach to Documenting RESTful APIs with Spring REST Docs](https://speakerdeck.com/jlstrater/a-test-driven-approach-to-documenting-restful-apis-with-spring-rest-docs) is also available.

For GR8Conf EU, the registration is open, and the doorbuster tickets are already gone. The early bird discount is still available (in limited quantities), so get your ticket today. You can read a bit more in the [GR8Conf Europe newsletter](http://eepurl.com/bUuee1), and the Agenda app is updated for the new season, thanks to Sergio del Amo and Cedric Champeau.
